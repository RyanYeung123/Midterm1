To run this file, you can use postman. 
Inside postman, you need to do first is to create a new collection and name it.
After that, you will see a table and you can choose different methods, 
for my code, you can choose get, post, put and delete. 
After choosing methods, you add the values for each data which is (name, age and your major)
then, you need to type localhost:4001/Students in the textbox next to the choosing methods,
and just click send button.
At the bottom of postman, you will see the output.
